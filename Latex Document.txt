Git helps to distribute work among fellow software developers over the internet by providing a powerful version of control system that tracks changes in code as well as documents. When used the platforms like GitHub, Git allows developers to store their work in a centralized online repository that can be accessed by anyone from anywhere in the world. Team members can clone the repository to their local devices, make updates, and push changes back to the shared repo. Git ensures that each contribution is recorded with a timestamp, author name, and message, making it easy to trace who did what and when. It also supports branching, which allows multiple people to work on different features or fixes simultaneously without interfering with each otherâ€™s progress. Once the work is ready, it can be reviewed and merged through pull requests. Git acts as a bridge that connects developers globally, enabling smooth collaboration and distribution of code over the internet.
